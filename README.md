# ML_Projects

A curated portfolio of my machine learning projects. Each project has a clear structure (`notebooks/`, `src/`, `data/`, `models/`) and a README with how to run, metrics, and results.

## Projects
- **Brain Tumor Classification (VGG16)** â€” Transfer learning on MRI brain images with VGG16; includes confusion matrix and training curves.  
  Path: `ML_Projects/ImageClassification/BrainTumorClassificationVGG16/`

## Repo Layout

## Getting Started
- Python 3.10+
- Create/activate a virtual environment
- Install per-project `requirements.txt` (inside each project)
- Open the notebook in `notebooks/` and follow the cells.

> Datasets and trained weights are intentionally ignored by Git. See each project README for how to obtain data.
